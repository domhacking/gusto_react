To Run the project in command at root of the file

watchify -t reactify components/Cupboard.js -o bundle.js -v


If I had more time I would have refactored the code, improved performance. By today I had started to understand the concepts of react more and found it easier to implement React methodology. Still lots to learn though!!! I enjoyed using it though.
